randio
======

Random number generator from rtl-sdr supported radio dongles.

    WARNING: I am not a cryptographer and have not formally verified
    the quality of the random data that Randio produces.  The data is
    based on data samples from random radio frequencies.  Placing your
    antenna in a high RF environment (outdoors in an urban area) or
    sampling a narrower, more active band of frequencies (like
    broadcast television) may produce better data.

randio provides a subclass of random.Random that acts like a normal
Python random number generator, but gets its seeds from an rtl-sdr
radio dongle commonly available for around $20 USD.

Usage
=====

randio can be installed from Pypi with pip or easy_install:

    pip install randio

And tested interactively from the interpreter by running the module:

    python -i -m 'randio'

When run as a script, the module creates a default randio object that
looks for rtl-sdr dongle number 0.  To have it use another dongle, set
the 'RANDIO_DEV_INDEX' environment variable before running the script.

When the module imported, there is a couple of second delay while
radio signals are sampled to provide a random number generator seed.
By default randio takes 1024 samples from 32 randomly chosen
frequencies between 64Mhz and 1100Mhz.  The number of samples,
frequencies, and frequency range can all be adjusted with arguments to
the Randio class constructor.  See the source code for details.

A randio object works like any other python Random subclass:

    >>> randio.random()
    0.8497721577857263
    >>> 

A new seed can be generated by calling the 'randio()' method.  This
may take a few seconds while frequencies are scanned.

    >>> randio.seed(randio.randio())

Calling the 'randio()' method directly returns the bare tuple of raw
sample data from the radio.

Randio objects also provide a 'sha512' hash function that returns a
hash object of the accumulated sample radio data.

    >>> randio.sha512().hexdigest()
    '61bb7e4a1170f2fbdc170ffd8760b192e0d0f3631358c94a87606594571af1beb6507877d3b2838706fc692fdae4ff503393765941d2b44bc0bd7f9e27cf19dd'

The 'sha512' method always gets fresh sample data per call, so will
allways take a few seconds to collect the samples.
